# Current Task: User Authentication Implementation

## Status: In Progress

### Completed Items
- Created token management service with blacklisting functionality
- Implemented user authentication service with registration and login
- Created API endpoints for registration, login, and logout
- Implemented JWT token handling with access and refresh tokens
- Added token refresh endpoint and functionality
- Implemented password reset functionality with email notifications
- Added email verification system with token-based verification
- Implemented rate limiting with Redis
- Created comprehensive test suite for authentication system
- Added OpenAI integration for email analysis
- Implemented API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger

### In Progress
- Setting up email service configuration
- Implementing session management
- Setting up monitoring
- Testing AI features

### Next Steps
1. Test AI features
2. Set up monitoring
3. Add email templates
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline
5. Implement session management

### Dependencies
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- Python-Jose (for JWT)
- Passlib (for password hashing)
- PostgreSQL
- FastAPI-Mail (for email notifications)
- Redis (for rate limiting)
- pytest (for testing)
- pytest-asyncio (for async tests)
- httpx (for API testing)
- OpenAI (for AI features)

### Technical Notes
- Using JWT for stateless authentication
- Implementing token blacklisting for logout
- Following OAuth2 password flow
- Using async/await for database operations
- Token refresh mechanism implemented with security checks
- Password reset tokens expire after 1 hour
- Email notifications for password reset
- Email verification with 24-hour expiring tokens
- Secure token-based verification flow
- Rate limiting with sliding window algorithm
- Redis-based rate limit tracking
- Comprehensive test coverage with pytest
- SQLite used for testing database
- Mock Redis for testing rate limiting
- OpenAI GPT-4 integration for email analysis
- Detailed API documentation with examples

### Security Considerations
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Token expiration and refresh flow
- Token blacklisting for logout
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting implemented for sensitive endpoints
- Refresh token validation and security
- Secure password reset flow with expiring tokens
- Email notifications for security events
- Email verification required for sensitive operations
- Verification tokens with secure expiration
- Protection against brute force attacks
- Test coverage for security features
- OpenAI API key security
- Rate limiting for AI endpoints

### Testing Requirements ✅
- Unit tests for auth services
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Security testing for token handling
- Load testing for concurrent auth requests
- Token refresh flow testing
- Password reset flow testing
- Email notification testing
- Email verification flow testing
- Rate limiting effectiveness testing
- AI feature testing (in progress)
