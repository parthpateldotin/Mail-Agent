# Alembic Migration Troubleshooting Log

## Summary

This log captures the conversation and troubleshooting process regarding issues with Alembic migration commands. The main challenges included:

- Receiving the error: `invalid command 'revision'` when attempting to run `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"`.
- Attempts were made to reinitialize the Alembic environment by removing and recreating the migrations directory.
- The `env.py` file was modified to handle async operations, then switched to using synchronous connections by replacing `postgresql+asyncpg` with `postgresql` in the URL.
- Various commands were executed with different PYTHONPATH configurations, using environment variable `ALEMBIC_CONFIG`, and even direct Python module calls (e.g., `python -m alembic.config ...`).
- Reinstallation of Alembic with different versions (1.14.1, 1.12.0, 1.11.1, 1.9.2, and 1.8.1) was attempted to resolve the issue, but the error persisted.
- Finally, a Docker cleanup was performed to reset the database, but the Alembic revision command continued to return an error.

## Commands Executed

- `docker-compose down -v` to drop all Docker containers and volumes.
- `docker-compose up -d` to restart the PostgreSQL container.
- Several attempts to run Alembic revision commands:
  - `PYTHONPATH=. alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"`
  - `python .venv/bin/alembic -c alembic.ini revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"`
  - `PYTHONPATH=. ALEMBIC_CONFIG=alembic.ini alembic revision -m "Initial migration" --autogenerate`
- Attempts using different Alembic versions (1.14.1, 1.12.0, 1.11.1, 1.9.2, 1.8.1) via `pip install alembic==<version>`.
- Adjustments in `migrations/env.py` to set the correct SQLAlchemy URL by replacing `postgresql+asyncpg` with `postgresql`.

## Outcome

Despite numerous attempts, the command `alembic revision` continued to throw the error `invalid command 'revision'`. This conversation log documents the troubleshooting steps taken, including modifications to configuration files and environment adjustments.

# Fresh Attempt: Docker Reset and Alembic Migration

## Initial Setup
1. Clean Docker environment
2. Start PostgreSQL container
3. Verify database connection
4. Attempt Alembic migration

## Action Plan
1. Docker Setup
   - Remove all existing containers, images, and volumes
   - Start fresh PostgreSQL container
   - Verify container health
2. Database Connection
   - Verify PostgreSQL connection
   - Check database creation
3. Alembic Configuration
   - Review alembic.ini settings
   - Check env.py configuration
4. Migration Attempt
   - Run initial migration command
   - Debug any issues

## Progress Log
### Step 1: Docker Cleanup ✅
- Executed `docker system prune -af --volumes` to remove all containers, images, and volumes
- Executed `docker network prune -f` to remove all custom networks
- Verified clean state with no containers or volumes present
- Total space reclaimed: 12.96GB
- Status: Complete

### Step 2: PostgreSQL Container Setup ✅
- Started PostgreSQL container using docker-compose
- Container Status: Healthy
- Port: 5432
- Container Name: aimail_postgres
- Status: Complete

### Step 3: Database Connection Verification ✅
- Successfully connected to PostgreSQL database
- Database name: aimail
- User: postgres
- No existing tables found (clean state)
- Status: Complete

### Step 4: Alembic Configuration Check ✅
- Verified alembic.ini configuration
  - Script location: migrations/
  - Using synchronous PostgreSQL driver for migrations
  - Database URL correctly configured
- Checked env.py setup
  - Models properly imported
  - Base metadata configured
  - Async to sync URL conversion implemented
- Models structure verified
  - Base class properly defined with common fields
  - User and Email models present
- Status: Complete

### Step 5: Migration Attempt ✅
- Attempted various approaches to run Alembic migrations:
  1. Direct command: `alembic revision --autogenerate`
  2. Reinstalled Alembic to version 1.8.1
  3. Upgraded to Alembic >= 1.12.0 (project requirement)
  4. Tried full path to script
  5. Used environment variable for config
  6. Reinstalled all dependencies in fresh virtual environment
  7. Added psycopg2-binary for PostgreSQL connection
  8. Created Python scripts to handle migration directly using Alembic API
- Issues encountered and resolved:
  - Initially all Alembic commands returning "invalid command" error
  - After reinstalling dependencies, got ModuleNotFoundError for psycopg2
  - After installing psycopg2-binary, back to "invalid command" error
  - Finally succeeded using direct Alembic API in Python scripts
- Results:
  - Successfully created initial migration
  - Successfully applied migration to database
  - Created tables: user, email, alembic_version
  - Verified table structures and relationships
- Status: Complete

### Next Steps
- The database is now ready for use
- Consider adding some seed data
- Document the migration process for future reference
